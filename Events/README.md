## Contributing

Please feel free to add content. However, by doing so, please pay attention to comply to the
following guidelines:
- The date of folder and file names have to match the following patterns:
    - Files should provide information about the concrete day (YYYY-MM-DD).
    - Folders should be named by year and month (YYYY-MM).
- Files (e.g. presentation slides) of one event are located within a folder for this specific event.
- Always add a file in the raw format (e.g., `.pptx`) **and** a finalized one (`.pdf`).

This way, people can access information fast and (hopefully) without too much effort. All files are
automatically sorted by alphabet and number, so the aforementioned naming style allows finding
events according to their date real quick.
