# Legal Regulations

Usage Control interactions require, as any other business activity, a solid legal basement. The current legislation does not know any kind of machine-to-machine contracts, therefore, the legal anchor must be provided from a different source. This source is usually a _framing contract_, which all Participants of a Data Space accept during their ramp-up phase and which obliges them to follow the obligations of the machine-readable contracts.

That implies that the escalation path in case of a documented usage contract validation does not end in the Data Space itself but - through the clauses of the framing contract - leads to the traditional national courts. Consequently, the task of every Usage Control system is to prevent misuse to the extend that it can control its environment but also to document any misuse beyond that line in transparent and immutable manners. The reliable notification of the Data Sovereign in these cases enables him to take appropriate actions and to prevent further validations.

Following this argumentation, it is not and cannot be in the responsibility of the Usage Control system to guarantee conformance to either the framing contract or the usage contracts but to increase the trust in their adherence.


## Data Sovereignty vs. Data Ownership

Even though commonly used, the concept of _Data Ownership_ does not exist from a legal perspective (see [IDS RAM](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-RAM_4_0/blob/35735d52310e0f745a947f7c8a48728b78b3eb8e/documentation/4_Perspectives_of_the_Reference_Architecture_Model/4_3_Governance_Perspective/4_3_5_Data_Ownership.md?plain=1#L11)) and, therefore, should not be used in the context of the EDC. While physical goods have an explicit owner, information - in particular digital data assets - are not controlled through ownership regulations.
In contrast, several other regulation regimes apply and need to be regarded. Most prominent, person-related data is protected out-of-the-box through GDPR regulations in EU countries. In addition, creative work can be covered through its copyright.
Nevertheless, significant amount of business-relevant data does not fall into any of those categories and, therefore, requires a further regulation mechanism. This mechanism can be established through individual usage contracts, which define permitted and prohibited usage, reimbursements, or further distributions.

In this sense, a Data Sovereign is the legal entity that has the capability to state such usage contracts and to make the data assets available according to them. In most cases, the Data Sovereign is an organization or company, which has empowered a certain group of employees - or to some degree automized agents - to decide on their behalf. The decisions made by these representatives are the foundation on which the EDC offers or accepts usage contracts.
